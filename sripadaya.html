             land of the Lord Buddha before in your life. Sri Pada(Adam's Peak) is first mentioned 
             (as `Samanthakuta') in the Deepawamsa, the earliest Pali chronicle, (4th century), and 
             also in the 5th century chronicle Mahawamsa, where it is stated that the Buddha visited
              the Sri Pada mountain peak.
