            The quaint city of Trincomalee also famously known as ‘Gokarna’ is an essential fragment of the country, contributing 
            towards the betterment and development of the district and in a nutshell, Sri Lanka. Trincomalee is a port city famous
             for its white sand beaches and most beautiful harbours. The locals here predominantly speak Tamil.

            Owing to its long history of civilian settlements, the town is quite prominent for its culture, tradition, and its
             well known historical sites. The city is situated on the east coast of the island and is almost 237 kms north-east of
              Colombo, the capital of the country. The Trincomalee or Gokarna Bay and the ‘Then Kailayam’ (also known as Kailash of 
              the South/Koneswaram) temple are some of the most famous spots in the city.
