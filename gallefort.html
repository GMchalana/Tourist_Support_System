        <p style="color:bisque;font-size:30px">
            Galle, a vibrant city that embraces its ancient and colonial past, is made famous by its 17th
             century Dutch fort, by far the best surviving European fort in Asia. The Galle Fort is a
              magnificent UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a living monument, inhabited by a bustling
               community, within the great ramparts, massive bastions and pepper pot towers. The once
                sleepy Galle Fort is now a dynamic area with a distinctively Mediterranean atmosphere. 
                Today, schools, administrative offices, companies, and courts, neighbour ancient buildings,
                 and visitors can spend a full day exploring its narrow streets and lanes. The tropical
                  rainforests at Hiyare and Kanneliya, close to Galle, provide opportunities for nature 
                  walks where you can see some of the island’s endemic flora and fauna. The golden sandy
                   beaches along the southern coast, and a number of luxurious retreats makes Sri Lanka’s 
                   south coast an ideal escape from frenetic everyday life.
