            Anuradhapura is a historical paradise as it houses several heritage monasteries, 
            palaces and monuments. It is known for its vast dagobas or brick stupas, ancient 
            ponds and pools and magnificent temples. The city was established as the first capital 
            of Sri Lanka in 377 BC. It was also at this time that Anuradhapura rose to prominence 
            as a seat of political and economic importance.

            Anuradhapura was built around a cut piece from the Bodhi Tree, or the 'tree of enlightenment',
            which is considered sacred by Buddhists. This city was on the peak of political and religious
            activities for around 900 years. It was invaded in 998 AD, after which it lost its importance. After
            being overlooked for several years, this World Heritage Site is now accessible again. Currently,
            Anuradhapura is an important religious site and a popular tourist attraction.
