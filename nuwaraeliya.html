            Travelling through winding roads and lush green valleys, tea estates situated 
            on the slopes and banks of the hills, with tiny streams and water falls and 
            the beautiful misty mountains , one can arrive at Nuwara Eliya town which offers
             you everything, as any other town does and more
             <br><br>
             Its unique climate, and often covered with an early morning mist and the cold
            tangy air and its fresh and invigorating atmosphere offers a typical English
            environment. Nuwara Eliya, which is situated among some of the most beautiful 
            tea estates also has the Golf course, race Course, horses, Rose gardens and 
            British style houses which all add up to a perfect vacation retreat, offering
            a level of perfection without equal.

            Many locals visit Nuwara Eliya during April/May which are the warmest months 
            when Colombo’s elite seek the relief of its cooling invigorating climate. Most 
            British visitors feel that they are in England when they visit Nuwara Eliya. In
            fact all foreign visitors to Sri Lanka always make it a point to visit Nuwara 
            Eliya to enjoy its ‘Home away from Home” feeling. Hence the name “Little England”
            which is a name given by many foreign visitors. The pink brick Victorian Post 
            office is a sure reminder of the British era.
